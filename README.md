# ℙétanque ℙaramétrique shiny application

## Installation

To install, you can use `remotes` (or `devtools`):
```
# install.packages("remotes") 
remotes::install_github("openanalytics/petanque")
```

## Running the application

The application can be launched with:
```
petanque::runShinyApp()
```

## Playing the game

The aim of the game is, as in a usual [game of Pétanque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C3%A9tanque), to land your balls as close as possible to the target ball (red).
Each player has 3 balls to throw, and players alternate throws.

The game is controlled with the keyboard as described at the bottom of the page.
